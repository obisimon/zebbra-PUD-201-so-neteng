# Network engineer 2.0 skills deep dive into open source libraries and neops.io @ Cisco Partner University Deutschland 2020

this repository is only intended as a resource for my speech at the cisco partner university 2020

try the jupiter notebooks **not** on real devices, because it has some evil (`reload`) commands in it.

## Getting started

### python libraries

```shell
git clone https://github.com/obisimon/zebbra-PUD-201-so-neteng.git

cd zebbra-PUD-201-so-neteng
pipenv install
pipenv run jupyter notebook
```

the jupyter notebooks were only used for testing and are not guided processes

### Vue.js / JsonSchemaForm

open jsonform.html in your prefered browser (only tested in brave)
